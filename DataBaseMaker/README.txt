So few things. The python file dataBaseMaker.py will help us create the databases that we will test on. Note that this will pick and choose 
random Customers and Sellers and give us different amount of Order items each time cuz a customer can have more than one order and etc.

I have added the archive folder with all the csv files downloaded (some we do not use so feel free to delete them but it doesnt really matter its what was downloaded and given to us)

In order to create a small, Medium, Large database you only need to change 2 things 

1) num_rows for the olist_customers_dataset.csv when read into the python file
2) num_rows for the olist_customers_dataset.csv when read into python file

If you cannot find these please let me know on discord OR ctrl-f for 'CHANGE BELOW' and read the comments accordingly


PS. They are preset to small at the moment
PPS. 

Happy coding :D
